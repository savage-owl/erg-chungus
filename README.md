Bicycle Smart Trainer Controller

There are numerous subscription based programs to control a bicycle smart trainer. Some of us are not interested in virtual cycling worlds or premade workouts. If you build your own workouts then all you need is a program that uses your workout to control the smart trainer. 

Let's build a program to control a bicycle smart trainer using an erg, mrc, or zwo file. 

Great features would include:
-Modern GUI
-Graphing of workout
-Graphing of sensor data (power, HR, etc...)
-Numerical display of sensor data
